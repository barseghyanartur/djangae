# Expando Model Support for Djangae

This app provides an equivalent to App Engine's `Expando` models on top of Django's ORM.

Note: this app is primarily to allow for ease-of-porting existing code from ndb.Expando. If you need dynamic data on a model, JSONField provides a more structured way of doing that.
